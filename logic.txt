Let's start with logic:

1. program opens with ascii clock picture and gives you options:
    clock in
    clock out
    display logs - opens another menu
    exit - closes the program
2. program will be connected to a sqlite database for collecting logs
3. display logs gives you following options:
    display total focus time or break time today or on a given date
    display last log
    display logs for given date (with options for 'today' or 'other given date' or 'all')
    display log with given index
    remove (with options 'last log' or 'index number')
4. clocking in, makes a "in" log and runs a 30 min timer, the timer runs in the console showing minutes and seconds (not sure if this part is possible), once reaches 00:00 it triggers a bell sound
5. timer can be interrupted by an interrupt hotkey, for example ctrl+F1. It will be prompted to user before the timer starts
6. No matter if the time is out and the bell has rang or user interrupted it, it doesn't make any log until user clocks out - in both cases the question "do you want to clock out" will be prompted. If possible in some bright red color (not sure if this is possible)
